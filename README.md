# Rice-Coursera-AlgorithmThinking1-Module1
Documenting Python codes for Coursera Course - Rice U - Algorithmic Thinking - Module 1

1. Project1_graphs.py was developed according to the requirements of Project1, it includes the following functions:
 * make_complete_graph(num_nodes)
 * compute_in_degrees(digraph)
 * in_degree_distribution(digraph)
 
 
2. q3.py refers to the code that is written to answer Question 3 - Question denoted in Application 1, specifically the DPA algorithm is implemented in this file to generate directed graph randomly.
 * The algorithm starts by creating a complete directed graph on m nodes. Then, the algorithm grows the graph by adding nâˆ’m nodes, where each new node is connected to m nodes randomly chosen from the set of existing nodes.
 
 3. alg is python file provided by the course, it is used to load citation graph as a dictionary and is used in Application 1.
